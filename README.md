Fractal-Bull
============
First iteration of a system to create a visual of a fractal nature from a continous pattern.
Based off of the work done by Computer Science classes under Castelleanos, somewhere in the cs site.

Current work shows that the complexities of the these fractal patterns come from placing a copy of the current form
onto the whole form, doubling the essental design.
The program as it is now does not ahve any true pattern recognition, but produces the same results as continous folding
at 90 degrees to the left.
This visible pattern seems to be the basis of other forms, with different transformations with the original shape 
becoming larger.

Representing the four cardinal directions with 0,1,2,3 in a counter-clockward direction, the different iterations of
this pattern go as such:
2
2|3
23|03
2303|0103
23030103|01210103
Or that the previous iteration is reflected and turned 90 degrees.

Further goals are to find the statistic height and length of the object, and to make the algorithim for finding the
fractal geometry complex enough to use things such as alternating directions and angles of rotation.

Have fun
